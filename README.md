# Cricket-Game
 
The following is a Cricket Game I made using Unity, for Indian Gaming company Games2Win.

The general overview of the project is as follows:

The objective is to create a prototype suitable for a 3D cricket game.  The protoytpe would allow a game designer to understand ball and bat movement, and the view of the gameplay area.  

In the real-world, bowlers bowl at speeds of 120km/h or more, some spinning the ball, some swinging it.  The batsman in turn has to react within 0.5 seconds, controlling both the direction of their short and the force applied. 

The purpose of this prototype is to understand how we would virtualize the real-world dimensions in the game.  This includes “scaling” down ball speeds, approximating hit points of bat to ball, to mimicking ball movements. 

Phase I - Ball Movement

Deliver a ball from the left side of the stumps towards the other end at a speed off 100kph and make the ball bounce on the pitch at the distance of 15 meters from the crease.

●	Make the bowling speed editable. By changing the bowling speed we should be able to see visual difference in the ball bounce height.
●	Put a movable marker on the pitch. This marker should work as ball bounce position on the pitch
●	Make the ball spin to the off and the leg side after it bounce

Bowling Controls 
Mechanics to change the pitch position or the ball.
●	Drag and place the pitch marker anywhere between the center of the pitch till the wickets at the batsman’s end

Phase II - Batting
When the ball enters the full length region (after 16 meters) on the pitch, swipe in any direction to hit the ball.
●	Hit the ball with a force and give an option to edit the force value

Batting Controls 
●	Once the ball is in the hitting region, swipe anywhere on the screen to hit the ball. 
●	Ball must travel in the direction of swipe
